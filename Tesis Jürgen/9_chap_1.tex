\section{heading 1: my chapter 1}

Heading 1 is the style you should use for the following headings in your thesis: List of Tables, List of Figures (List of Abbreviations, Schemes, and so on), Chapter titles, References, and Appendix titles. If you are writing in APA style, note that the titles formatted as Heading 1 do not count as an APA heading.

I want to cite something here \parencite{zuo2019standing}. I want to want to try cite~\textcite{zuo2019standing} with in-line style.


Let me add a figure here~\cref{fig:1}:
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \captionsetup{width=0.6\linewidth} %% change width to adjust the caption alignment
  \caption{Old capital museum}
  %  \includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{fig1}
  \label{fig:1}
\end{figure}
