\chapter{ABOUT THE APPENDICES}

There are two groups of appendices.
The first group are general appendices;
the second group are domain-specific appendices.

Each example consists of some \LaTeX\ output
followed by the corresponding input lines.
Some \LaTeX\ input lines only define things
and don't produce any output.
Each chunk in the input file begins with
\verb+\begin{VerbatimOut}{z.out}+
then has the \LaTeX\ input for the example,
% Don't literally end VerbatimOut on next line.
and ends with {\tt \char'134 end\char'173 VerbatimOut\char'175},
followed by a blank line,
followed by a line that begins with
\verb+\My+.

\end{VerbatimOut}

\section{Text math}

If items in a list are narrow like these Greek characters,\\
    \I2 \verb+$\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$+\\
I'd input the line like this\\
    \I2 \verb+$\alpha$,~$\beta$, and~$\gamma$+\\
where the \verb+~+ is a tie
that ties together what's before and after it on the same line of the output
\cite[page~92]{knuth2012}.

This text is the correct length to show what happens with and without ties:
$\alpha$,
$\beta$,
and $\gamma$.
See how the line gets split
and the~$\gamma$ is at the beginning of the line?

This text is the correct length to show what happens with and without ties:
$\alpha$,~$\beta$,
and~$\gamma$.
See how the line gets compressed a little bit so the~$\gamma$
is not at the beginning of the line?
