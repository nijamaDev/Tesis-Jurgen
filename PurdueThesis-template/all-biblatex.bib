%  I like to order the entries by author, and within author by date.
%  If, for example, I later added a second 1994 publication for Goossens,
%  I would give it the key, "goossens1994b".
%
%  From http://isbn.org/about_ISBN_standard
%      For more than thirty years, ISBNs were 10 digits long.
%      On January 1, 2007 the ISBN system switched to a 13-digit
%      format.  Now all ISBNs are 13-digits long.
%
%  The apa7-<number> references are from the _Publication Manual
%  of the American Psychological Association_, 7th edition,
%  pages 317--352.
