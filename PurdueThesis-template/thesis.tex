%  Be sure to sign up for the PurdueThesis mailing list at
%      https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECN/mailman/listinfo/purduethesis-list
%  so you learn of new versions of this software.  You must be on that
%  mailing list to receive help with this software.
%
%  This is the template root file for an example thesis (for master's
%  degree) or dissertation (for a PhD).  From now on "thesis" will
%  refer to both of these unless stated otherwise.
%
%  Search for "IMPORTANT" below to see three important comments.  One
%  concerns how to fix errors you get from using the "|" character.
%
%  LaTeX systems include auxiliary programs to do bibliographies,
%  indexes, etc.  The latexmk program runs the fewest programs needed
%  to update your thesis.  latexmk runs automatically on Overleaf.  If
%  you're LaTeXing your document on a non-Overleaf system you may need
%  to run latexmk manually.
%
%  To make a final PDF file before you turn in your thesis do
%      latexmk -g thesis
%  This makes sure than everything is done for your final version.

%     \graphicspath{<dir-list>}
%
%         This optional declaration may be used to specify a list of
%         directories in which to search for graphics files.  The
%         format is the same as for the LaTeX 2e primitive \input@path.
%         A list of directories, each in a {} group (even if there is
%         only one in the list).  For example:
%             \graphicspath{{eps/}{tiff/}}
%         would cause the system to look in the subdirectories eps and
%         tiff of the current directory.  (All modern TeX systems use /
%         as the directory separator, even on Windows.)
%
%         The default setting of this path is \input@path that is:
%         graphics files will be found whereever TeX files are found.
%
% Look in the "graphics" subfolder for graphics files.
% This is done to reduce the number of files in the main thesis folder
% so the ones in there are easier to find.

%     {
%       \include{ap-physics}
