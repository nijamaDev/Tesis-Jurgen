\chapter{FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS}

This appendix lists all frequently asked questions.
Each frequently asked question is assigned a number when I learn of it.
Numbers are 1, 2,~\ldots~.
I started keeping track
of frequently asked questions
in this fashion
on March 1, 2022.

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
  \toprule
  \bf Priority& \bf Color\\
  \midrule
  high or easy& \color{red}red\\
  medium& \color{yellow}yellow\\
  low& \color{green}green\\
  waiting on someone else& \color{black}black\\
  done& \color{black}black\\
  not assigned yet& \color{gray}gray\\
  \bottomrule\\
\end{tabular}

See the

)\\
