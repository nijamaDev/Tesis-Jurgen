\chapter{BUGS}

This appendix lists all bugs/comments/issues/etc\@.
under the generic label `bug'.

Each bug
is assigned the next number
when it is added to this list.
I started keeping track of bugs
in this fashion
on February 26, 2022,
and some previously known bugs are included in this list.
A color indicates a bug's priority:

\begin{inlinetable}
  \newcommand{\Color}[1]{\color{#1}#1}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Priority}& \textbf{Color}\\
    \midrule
    high&    \Color{red}\\
    low&     \Color{green}\\
    waiting& \Color{blue}\\
    done&    \Color{black}\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{inlinetable}

See the
|ap-bugs.tex|
file for the \LaTeXLogo\ input for this appendix.

\section{These bugs are waiting on a reply from someone other than Mark Senn}

\MyBug{10}{wait}
Using
|linktoc = section|
does not work with captions with
|\frac|.\\
Reported by Mark Senn on 2021-05-27.
In the short-term,
check with Ashlee Messersmith
if {\tt linktoc = page} can be used.
If that's ok make the change
and look into changing captions from my code
to \LaTeXLogo's code.
Waiting on Ashlee Messersmith.
